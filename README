Name of our project: Online Student Job Board

Project management tool: Microsoft Project

Description: We created an online job board for Computer Science students. This job board allows 
employers to directly advertise open positions to Computer Science students at UoA.

Technologies: ASP.NET Entity Framework Core, SQL Server Express, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, jQuery 3.5.1,
Bootstrap 4.6.0, Summernote.js, Bootstrap-Table.js, Sweet-Alert.js, Echarts.js.

Instructions: dwad

URL of website: http://studentjobboard-env.eba-yxrh674p.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Future plan: For future development it would be a good idea to look into a system where users can like/follow
jobs that they are interested in. Also, you could expand the functionality of the employer view of the site.

Acknowledgements: We should mention our clients, Giovanni and Shana for giving us a strong vision for where
they wanted to the project to go in terms of development.
